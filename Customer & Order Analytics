--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID <> ''AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID <> ''AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6 
AND order_id IS NOT NULL AND order_id <> '' AND order_id <> 'ORDER ID';
--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT SUM(Quantity*price), Product as Total_Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product <> 'Product' AND Product <> ''
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT location, Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity*price) as Total_Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;
--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum) AS Customers_ordered_more_than_2_products_in_February, AVG(Quantity*price) as AverageAmountSpent   
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity>2 
AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID <> '' AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';
